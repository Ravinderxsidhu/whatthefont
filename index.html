            <p>[Verse 1]
            I'm hurting, baby, I'm broken down
            I need your loving, loving, I need it now
            When I'm without you, I'm something weak
            You got me begging, begging, I'm on my knees</p>
            
            <p>[Pre-Chorus]
            I don't wanna be needing your love
            I just wanna be deep in your love
            And it's killing me when you're away
            Ooh, baby
            'Cause I really don't care where you are
            I just wanna be there where you are
            And I gotta get one little taste</p>
            
            <p>[Chorus]
            Your sugar, yes, please
            Won't you come and put it down on me?
            I'm right here, 'cause I need
            Little love, a little sympathy
            Yeah, you show me good loving, make it alright
            Need a little sweetness in my life
            Your sugar, yes, please
            Won't you come and put it down on me?</p>
            
            <p> [Verse 2]
            Babe, my broken pieces, you pick them up
            Don't leave me hanging, hanging, come give me some
            When I'm without you, I'm so insecure
            You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for

            <p>[Bridge]
            Yeah
            I want that red velvet, I want that sugar sweet
            Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
            I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way
            'Cause girl, you're hotter than a Southern California day
            Never wanna play no games, you don't gotta be afraid
            Don't give me all that shy shit
            No makeup on, that's my sugar</p>
